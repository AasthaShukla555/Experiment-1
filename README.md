BASIC SINGLE PAGE APPLICATION (SPA) USING REACT

-> Aim :-

To design and develop a Single Page Application (SPA) using a modern frontend framework (React with Vite), implement client-side routing, manage component state using React Hooks, integrate an external API, and deploy the application to a hosting platform.

-> Theory :-

A Single Page Application (SPA) is a web application that loads a single HTML file and dynamically updates its content without refreshing the browser. Navigation and data updates are handled on the client side, providing faster performance and a smooth user experience.

React is a component-based JavaScript library used for building interactive user interfaces. Vite is a modern build tool that enables fast development and efficient bundling. React Router allows navigation between pages without reloading the browser, while React Hooks such as useState and useEffect help manage state and lifecycle events.

-> Steps to Perform the Experiment :-

Step 1: Environment Setup

Node.js, npm, Git, and a code editor are installed and verified to ensure the system is ready for frontend development.

Step 2: Project Creation

A new React project is created using Vite and required dependencies are installed to start the development server successfully.

Step 3: Project Structure Setup

The project is organized into components and pages to maintain modularity and reusability of code.

Step 4: Client-Side Routing

Client-side routing is implemented using React Router to navigate between different pages without refreshing the browser.

Step 5: State Management and API Integration

React Hooks are used to manage application state and lifecycle events, and an external API is integrated to fetch and display dynamic data.

Step 6: Build and Deployment

The application is optimized for production and deployed to a hosting platform, generating a live deployment link.

-> Learning Outcomes :-

After completing this experiment, the student is able to:

Understand Single Page Application architecture

Set up a React development environment using Vite

Create reusable and modular UI components

Implement client-side routing

Manage state using React Hooks

Integrate external APIs

Deploy a production-ready SPA

-> Conclusion :-

The experiment successfully demonstrated the creation of a modern Single Page Application using React and Vite. It provided hands-on experience with client-side routing, state management, API integration, and deployment, reinforcing core frontend development concepts.
